This plugin implements an HTTP interface to all Traffic Server statistics. The
metrics returned are in a JSON format, for easy processing. This plugin is now
part of the standard ATS build process, and should be available after install.

To enable this plugin, add to the plugin.conf file:

  stats_over_http.so


After starting Traffic Server, the JSON metrics are now available on the
default URL:

    http://host:port/_stats


where host and port is the hostname/IP and port number of the server. You can
optionally modify the path to use, and this is highly recommended in a public
facing server. For example:

    stats_over_http.so 81c075bc0cca1435ea899ba4ad72766b


and the URL would then be e.g.

    https://host:port/81c075bc0cca1435ea899ba4ad72766b



This is weak security at best, since the secret could possibly leak if you are
careless and send it over clear text.
